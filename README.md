# 🚀 My Project Collection

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repo contains copies of my various projects across different domains, including **data science, machine learning, web development, cloud computing, and game development**. Below is a brief description of each project. Feel free to explore! 👇

## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ **D3Website**
📌 A web-based data visualization project using **D3.js** to create interactive charts and graphs. This project explores different data visualization techniques and provides insights through dynamic and interactive UI components.

### 2️⃣ **Data Cleaning And Observing**
📌 A **data preprocessing and analysis** project focused on cleaning, transforming, and observing patterns in raw datasets. It involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis using **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.

### 3️⃣ **Forest Fire Prediction** 🔥
📌 A **machine learning project** that predicts the impact of forest fires using classification and regression models. It leverages **weather data and fire indicators** to estimate fire severity and burned areas. 
- Best Model: **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- Tools: **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib**

### 4️⃣ **MasterMind Game Dev (ARMlite)** 🎮
📌 A **game development project** built using **ARMlite**. It is a digital recreation of the classic **MasterMind puzzle game**, incorporating logic-based challenges and interactive gameplay elements.

### 5️⃣ **Serverless Architectural Design (AWS)** ☁️
📌 A **cloud-based project** focused on **serverless architecture** using **AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3**. This project demonstrates how to build highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without managing servers.
